These are the leetcode exercises I’ve done  in JS.
I’ve worked on these in March and April 2020, spending around 3 hours daily. 
Follow the links below to see submissions screenshots and solutions details.


Solutions that pass all the tests:


[Bulls and Cows](https://github.com/alisa-rogers/solved-leetcode-problems/tree/master/bulls%20and%20cows) - analyzing string similarity.


[Reverse String](https://github.com/alisa-rogers/solved-leetcode-problems/tree/master/reverse%20string) - reversing string in-place.


[Last Word Length](https://github.com/alisa-rogers/solved-leetcode-problems/tree/master/last%20word%20length) - counting the length of the last word in a string that consists of words and spaces.


[Vaid Palindrome](https://github.com/alisa-rogers/solved-leetcode-problems/tree/master/valid%20palindrome) - checking if the string is a palindrome.

[First Unique Character in a String](https://github.com/alisa-rogers/solved-leetcode problems/tree/master/first%20unique%20character%20in%20a%20string) - finding the first character that appears in a string only once.

[Number of Segments](https://github.com/alisa-rogers/solved-leetcode-problems/tree/master/number%20of%20segments%20in%20a%20string) - counting the number of segments in a string.

Other solutions are drafts; I continue to work on them.
